      <h2>How to Stay Safe Before, During & After Storms</h2>
      <p>
        Knowing what to do can save your life and the lives of others. Storms can
        develop quickly and bring dangerous conditions such as high winds, flash
        flooding, lightning, hail, storm surge, and tornadoes. Preparing ahead
        of time, responding safely during the event, and recovering carefully
        afterward significantly reduce injuries, property damage, and long-term
        health risks.
      </p>

      <!-- BEFORE -->
      <h3>Before a Storm (Expanded)</h3>
      <p>
        Preparation is the most important step in storm safety. Planning early
        reduces panic and helps families respond quickly when warnings are issued.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Secure outdoor items like trash cans, chairs, and toys to prevent them from becoming dangerous flying debris in high winds.</li>
        <li>Charge your phone, power banks, and backup batteries in case of power outages.</li>
        <li>Prepare an emergency kit with water (one gallon per person per day), non-perishable food, flashlight, batteries, first aid supplies, and medications.</li>
        <li>Know your shelter location or evacuation route and practice it with your family.</li>
        <li>Bring pets indoors and prepare food, water, and carriers for them.</li>
        <li>Check weather alerts from trusted sources and understand warning levels.</li>
        <li>Fill your gas tank in case evacuation becomes necessary.</li>
        <li>Store important documents such as IDs and insurance papers in waterproof bags.</li>
        <li>Trim weak tree branches and clear gutters to reduce storm damage and flooding risk.</li>
        <li>Learn how to shut off utilities such as gas, water, and electricity if instructed by authorities.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- DURING -->
      <h3>During a Storm (Expanded)</h3>
      <p>
        When a storm is happening, your focus should be on immediate safety.
        Staying indoors and following official guidance can prevent serious injury.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stay indoors and away from windows, glass doors, and exterior walls.</li>
        <li>Use flashlights instead of candles to prevent accidental fires.</li>
        <li>Listen to weather alerts on your phone, battery powered radio, or TV for updates.</li>
        <li>Do not drive through floodwater just a small amount can sweep vehicles away.</li>
        <li>If told to evacuate, leave immediately and follow designated routes.</li>
        <li>Stay in a small interior room or basement during tornado warnings.</li>
        <li>Move to higher ground immediately if flooding begins.</li>
        <li>Avoid using electrical appliances during lightning storms.</li>
        <li>Keep emergency supplies nearby in case you must shelter in place for several hours.</li>
        <li>Remain calm and help children or elderly family members stay reassured.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- AFTER -->
      <h3>After a Storm (Expanded)</h3>
      <p>
        Even after the storm has passed, serious hazards can remain. Recovery
        should be done carefully and patiently to prevent further injuries.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid floodwater; it may contain sewage, chemicals, sharp debris, or hidden electrical currents.</li>
        <li>Stay away from downed power lines and report them immediately.</li>
        <li>Check on neighbors, especially older adults, young children, or people with disabilities.</li>
        <li>Throw away spoiled or contaminated food, especially if refrigeration was lost.</li>
        <li>Wear gloves, boots, and protective clothing when cleaning up debris.</li>
        <li>Take photos of damage for insurance and disaster assistance claims.</li>
        <li>Watch for mold growth in homes and dry wet areas as quickly as possible.</li>
        <li>Do not use wet electrical appliances until inspected.</li>
        <li>Operate generators outdoors only and away from windows to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning.</li>
        <li>Seek emotional support if feeling stressed, anxious, or overwhelmed after the event.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Storm safety is a shared responsibility. By preparing early, acting wisely
        during emergencies, and helping communities recover safely, we can reduce
        the devastating impacts of severe weather. Education, awareness, and
        cooperation save lives.
